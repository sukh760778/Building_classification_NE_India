## Building_classification_NE_India
This repository contains the representative data, codes, and trained models for building classification using Google Street View images and Convolution neural networks.

## Repository Content

Data/: Contains representative GSV image data for each class used to train the models.

Code/: Jupyter notebooks for data processing and Model training.

Model/: Weights of the best-trained model (ready to use) to classify the images.

## Different classes of buildings which the present model classifies:
