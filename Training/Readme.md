Project Notebooks
This repository contains Jupyter notebooks related to image processing and deep learning model training. Below is a brief description of each notebook:
1. Hyper_param_tuning.ipynb
This notebook is focused on hyperparameter tuning for deep learning models.
It includes:
	-Grid Search and Random Search for hyperparameter optimization
	-Tuning parameters such as learning rate, batch size, and number of layers
	-Performance evaluation and comparison of different hyperparameter settings
2. CropAndSave.ipynb
This notebook deals with image preprocessing, specifically cropping and saving images. 
It includes:
	-Loading and reading image datasets
	-Cropping images to a specified size
	-Saving processed images for further model training
3. Training Jupyter notebooks
These notebooks involves training different deep learning models such as Inception, Xception, MobileNet & EfficientNet. 
It includes:
	-Data preprocessing and augmentation
	-Model architecture and training process
	-Performance metrics and evaluation
